            Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are upgrading their networks in urban and dense urban environments to enable
            faster service and meet the growing digital demands of the future. To do so, they must ensure high quality
            of service (QoS) and a consistent end-user experience everywhere and at any time, especially during peak
            usage hours.</p>

        <p class="p2" style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px; font-weight: 400;">Expand and Modernize Your Networks

            Urban Solution allows MNOs to expand and modernize their networks with an urban-ready, ALL G, Open RAN
            solution which is O-RAN Alliance compliant running on 7.2 radios. Our solution is easy to install,
            high-performing and reduces Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) while simplifying maintenance and enabling a broad
            ecosystem of partners.</p>

            With commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) vBBU hardware our Urban Solution enables Open RAN radios, resource
            orchestration, network slicing and subscriber management across All Gs – 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G and beyond. Our
            solution has advanced through the 3GPP and O-RAN Alliance release roadmap and is supporting the foundational
            features and capabilities for strong network performance in high-capacity urban environments.

    <div class="features">
        <h1 style="font-weight: 400;">Features and Capabilities</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 450;">Our Urban Solution is an agile, software-based approach to RAN
            infrastructure, which is designed to allow MNOs to quickly deploy network upgrades at a lower TCO. The
            following describes the features and benefits of our state-of-the-art Urban Solution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Innovate</strong> – Proprietary interfaces and limited flexibility with legacy suppliers make it
                challenging for MNOs to maintain, expand, and upgrade their networks to meet future demands. With our
                Parallel Wireless Urban solution, MNOs can avoid vendor lock-in, scale and enable new innovative
                services seamlessly with cloud-native centralized tools such as Continuous Integration/Continuous
                Delivery (CI/CD), DevOps, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).</li>

            <li><strong>Futureproof for 5G</strong> – MNOs need to upgrade their networks to prepare for the explosive
                data demands such as Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, autonomous driving, and digital health.
                With our Urban solution MNOs can upgrade their networks to any G with a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
                vBBU which is easy to install, has open interfaces and supports a broad ecosystem of vendors across 2G,
                3G, 4G and 5G, preparing networks for the future.
                <p>Easy to install, modernize and expand networks – The costs to deploy and maintain networks and the
                    lack of interoperability can be daunting as many operators are supporting 2G voice while migrating
                    to 4G data and preparing for the greater bandwidth possibilities of 5G. Easily change and upgrade
                    technologies to support emerging needs with our cloud-native software-based solution.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)</strong> – Network Operations Center (NOC), zoning and
                permits, management services, power and backhaul, are a few of the many expenses required to maintain
                and upgrade networks. A cloud-native, software-defined architecture with state-of-the art features such
                as RAN automation, self-configuration, hands free software testing, integration and delivery drives down
                costs and improves interoperability. A container based DU/CU implementation across ALL Gs, enables
                faster time-to-market for new services and features enabling OPEX and CAPEX savings.</li>

            <li><strong>Enhance end user experience</strong> – MNOs need to deliver a high quality and consistent
                experience everywhere, and all times, including during peak usage hours in high-capacity urban
                environments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) enable seamless software upgrades
                utilizing data to optimize network performance in urban environments, delivering optimal subscriber
                throughput and quality of service. With open non-proprietary interfaces, the Parallel Wireless Urban
                Solution addresses network overloads during high peak hours, ensuring ubiquitous coverage, enabling
                state-of-the-art applications such as IoT, and exceeding customer expectations.</li>

    <div class="deployment" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%;">
        <h1 style="font-weight: 400;">Deployment Scenarios</h1>
        <p>Mobile Network Operators must have flexibility with network deployments while simultaneously keeping Capital
            Expenses (CAPEX) and Operating Expenses (OPEX) down, which is extremely important in high-capacity, dense
            urban environments. Our Urban Solution is ALL G, O-RAN compliant and enables cost conscious mobile operators
            to overcome deployment barriers while meeting necessary targets of generating new revenue, improving end
            user experience, reducing TCO and making their networks future-proof.</p>
        <p>With our lean Open RAN cloud-native software solution on a modest server and Open RAN automation with DevOps
            and CI/CD, network upgrades and software updates are easier and faster to roll out, thus improving TCO.
            Multi-vendor and multi-operator support allows flexible deployments even in the most difficult urban
            locations.</p>
